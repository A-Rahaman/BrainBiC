# BrainBiC
A biclustering algorithm with a primary application on the brain's functional connectivity data. 
A deep learning framework that jointly stratifies subjects and features, enabling effective navigation of the data manifold and meaningful knowledge discovery. It leverages semantic locality to preserve coherence in subgrouped neural patterns and jointly optimizes sample and attribute assignment probability distributions for novel bicluster retrieval. Comprehensive experiments on multiple neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that BrainBiC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying neurologically meaningful brain connectivity substructures. The extracted connectivity signatures are
highly modular, show strong associations with cognitive and behavioral variables, and reveal disruptions in functional integration within subcortical, sensorimotor, and visual circuits. These findings position BrainBiC as a robust framework for modeling disease heterogeneity and associated connectivity alterations, advancing data-driven precision psychiatry.

* A novel semantic locality implementation that diverges from traditional graph Laplacian approaches by imposing constraints directly on latent representations rather than reconstructed outputs, facilitating more principled control over learned feature embeddings. Our proposed scheme achieves latent space regularization at the source of the transformation, potentially leading to more robust and interpretable embeddings.
