# BrainBiC - a deep biclustering framework 
Jointly stratifies subjects and features, enabling effective navigation of the data manifold and meaningful knowledge discovery. It leverages semantic locality to preserve coherence in subgrouped neural patterns and jointly optimizes sample and attribute assignment probability distributions for novel bicluster retrieval. 

* A novel semantic locality implementation that diverges from traditional graph Laplacian approaches by imposing constraints directly on latent representations rather than reconstructed outputs, facilitating more principled control over learned feature embeddings. Our proposed scheme achieves latent space regularization at the source of the transformation, potentially leading to more robust and interpretable embeddings.
* Application to the brain's functional connectivity identifies neurologically meaningful brain communities strongly associated with cognitive and behavioral variables.
* These findings position BrainBiC as a robust framework for modeling disease heterogeneity and associated connectivity alterations, advancing data-driven precision psychiatry.
